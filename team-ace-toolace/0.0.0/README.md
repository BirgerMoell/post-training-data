Recorded coverage: en

Language codes use ISO 639-3 plus ISO 15924, matching the OpenEuroLLM training-data catalogue convention. Broad multilingual entries remain unenumerated until their per-language composition is measured.

A recorded path means that the artifact existed at the verification date. Recheck storage, access permissions, revision, configuration, split, and checksums before a run.

## <a id="use">Terms of Use</a>

Apache-2.0

Verify the terms of every upstream component and transformed artifact before use; this catalogue statement is operational metadata, not legal clearance.

## <a id="post-training-use">Post-Training Use & Readiness</a>

- For RLVR/GRPO, identify the prompt, reference answer, and deterministic verifier or reward before including the source.
- Preserve tool schemas, calls, arguments, outputs, and abstention examples; validate that the target chat template can represent them.
- Pin an immutable public revision and record the exact configuration and split used.

### Operational state and ownership

- **Owner / lead:** Birger
- **Source type:** HF dataset
- **Priority:** P1
- **License / access:** Apache-2.0

## <a id="quality">Quality, Safety & Exclusions</a>

Before production use, record license/access approval, privacy and PII review, quality filters, deduplication, benchmark-contamination checks, language-balance results, and any excluded subsets. A published catalogue entry is not by itself a legal, safety, or quality approval.

## <a id="curator">Catalogue Curator</a>

Birger

This is the recorded operational owner or lead. Catalogue review and release approval may be assigned separately.
